# Real Estate Price Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
The **Real Estate Price Analysis and Prediction** project focuses on analyzing and predicting real estate prices using various machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical property data, the project seeks to uncover patterns and relationships that influence property values, ultimately providing a predictive model to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and converts categorical variables into numerical formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes data to identify trends, distributions, and outliers using plots and summary statistics.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates new features that enhance model performance, such as interaction terms or polynomial features.
- **Regression Modeling:** Implements various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict property prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared, along with visualizations of prediction results.
- **Visualization:** Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating informative plots that summarize findings and insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Python Script
## Results
The project showcases the model's performance through various metrics and visualizations, which are detailed in the output directory. Key findings include the most influential features affecting real estate prices, along with visual plots that illustrate predictions vs. actual prices.

## Future Work
- Explore additional regression algorithms or ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy.
- Incorporate additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Develop a web application to allow users to input property features and receive price predictions.
